# Bluetooth DOWN INIT RUNNING
The bluetooth status changes to DOWN INIT RUNNING then freezes. Already tried to overcome this from resetting hci until restarting the bluetooth service but it was still stuck, with resetting the Bluetooth firmware more efficiently than restarting a PC or mini-PC. 

## Problem Solved
Before running your program or main.py, first run the hciChecker.py program, so that when a problem occurs it can be resolved directly by resetting the bluetooth firmware.
